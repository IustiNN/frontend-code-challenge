# frontend-code-challenge

## PART A: HTML + CSS

- I didn't choose to use a preprocessor because I didn't think it was worth the effort for this number of CSS lines
- I used [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) to build the cards a little faster

## PART B: Javascript

- I'm using Vue js because it's lightweight and really fast. Also I wanted to give it a try.
- I display a list with the first 10 advertisements of vacant apartments.
- You have the option to click a button to load more ads
- You can click on the ad to go to a detail page
- used ES6
- wrote Unit Tests

### Todos

 - Write MORE Tests
 - clean the code
 - add more information to the detail page
